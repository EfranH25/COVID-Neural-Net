"Notes"
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates. "

"The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,212 in 2018. This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm). For 2018 and historical thresholds, use [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html)."
