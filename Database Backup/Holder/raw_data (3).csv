"Notes"
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.   "
""
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage.  For example, a person reporting having Medicaid coverage and another type of coverage would be categorized as having Medicaid coverage in this analysis."
""
"* The count of people with Medicare excludes those who report having both Medicare and Medicaid coverage, also known as dual eligibles. If these individuals were instead categorized as having Medicare, the total number of people with Medicare would increase as follows:"
"     - 2018: from 43,837,300 to 54,685,100"
"     - 2017: from 42,802,900 to 53,401,400"
"     - 2016: from 41,628,600 to 52,099,100"
"     - 2015: from 40,558,200 to 50,747,800"
"     - 2014: from 39,364,700 to 49,231,400"
"     - 2013: from 37,939,800 to 47,515,000"
"     - 2012: from 36,470,400 to 46,081,400"
"     - 2011: from 35,074,700 to 44,427,200"
"     - 2010: from 34,335,100 to 43,246,000"
"     - 2009: from 33,037,500 to 41,876,400"
"     - 2008: from 32,115,800 to 39,037,500"
